# sonos-agent
## description
Basic agent manager that listens for RFID or NFC uids over MQTT and either plays a song or assoicates the current playing song with a uid not in the database.  Inspired by  https://shawnrk.github.io/songblocks/ and requires an NFC or RFID reader that talks MQTT (such as: https://github.com/jayaras/esp8266-nfc-reader).
